 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
I think I was really hard on myself about how much I am learning/ know. I did question myself during the Free Code Camp part. It was nice to hear from kelly and Dougal not to worry right now as at this stage I am not expected to know all about JavaScript. It will come during the next few sprints.

What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
I am going to try to build my understanding of JavaScript. I think this will help make me feel better about everything.
