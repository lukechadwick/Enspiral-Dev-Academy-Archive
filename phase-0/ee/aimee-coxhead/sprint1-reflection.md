What did I do well this sprint?
  I took the time to look at all the material that was given and understand it before starting the assignments. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
  Meditation! But I will stick at it for the 10 days.

What can I improve on next sprint?
  Being conscious of what my time is being spent on and is it worth it? After doing the timeboxing activity and reflecting on my time I can see that sometimes the things I enjoyed were the things I spent more time on.
