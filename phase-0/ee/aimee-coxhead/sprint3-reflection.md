What did I do well this sprint?<br>
I was able to do some of the elements that I wanted like the drop-down box for my nav bar. When I first did the drop-down box it stayed to the left. I was then able to see what I thought was stopping it and then rework my CSS code so that it went to the center.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
Because of the end of term and finishing up at school I didnâ€™t start this sprint for a while. This meant that when I started I did have to spend a little bit of time going over what I have learnt previously. From now on I would like to be coding often.

 What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
I feel that now I am back into doing this I would really like to keep this motivation going and stay focused. I have a bit of catching up to do but I believe that I can do it if I stay motivated!
