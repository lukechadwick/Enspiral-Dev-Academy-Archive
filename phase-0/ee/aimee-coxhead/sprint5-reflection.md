What did I do well this sprint?<br>
I was able to see what was happening in the code that was given and modify this slightly so that it did what I wanted it to do. I was also able to pseudocode the counter question and I was so happy when I got this working.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
I think I put off doing my blogs for too long. Once I get started on the blogs I can actually end up learning a lot from them but I found them hard to start this week.

<br>
What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
I really need to stay focus and make sure I can get everything done before bootcamp. I am going to try and put more time aside each day so that I can get it all done.
