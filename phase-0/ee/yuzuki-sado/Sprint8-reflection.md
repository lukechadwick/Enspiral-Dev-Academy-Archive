What did I do well this sprint?<br>
I am very happy with how it went with my calculator and fixed some problems at the very end.
What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
I tried to use skeleton CSS but I seem to have forgotten how to use it. I took way too long to 
give up on skeleton CSS and change my stylesheet to main.css. I should have known
how to give up if there is another way I could do it. <br>
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
 I should not spend too much time on something I cannot figure out. I should ask for help earlier or think of different solutions.
