 What did I do well this sprint?
 <br>I did well googling and trying something. It was very challenging for me to understand
 some concepts (mainly array and objects) but google definitely helped me solved many problems!
 <br>What didn't I do well this sprint?
 <br>I am under the pressure of completing phrase-0 in time so I feel I rushed through 
 this sprint. Hopefully I will have some time to look back to this.
<br> What can I improve on next sprint?
<br>I should take some notes so that I can review when I am not in front of the computer.
