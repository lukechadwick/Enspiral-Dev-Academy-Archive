What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?<br>
I have managed to make it to the last sprint in time. Although I am still learning
I am way more confortable using HTML and CSS.<br>
What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?<br>
I wish I had managed more time to review each sprint and be not too stressed and worried about 
not making it to the bootcamp. <br>
What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?<br>
I have not only learnt how to code, how to use the command line, hot to use github
but also learnt to ask for help.
