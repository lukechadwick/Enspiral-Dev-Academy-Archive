-What did I do well this sprint?
I managed to make it through although I thought I could not while I was doing it.
It also forced me to review the past materials and ensure I understand the concepts.
-What didn't I do well this sprint?
I felt like I have not learnt anything in the past as the assignments were very challenging.
-What can I improve on next sprint?
I can use the Siberian North Railroad skill next time when I have an emotional meltdown.
