 What did I do well this sprint?
 <br> The Basic Algorithm Scripting was really hard but I managed to keep myself from getting too stressed.
 <br> What didn't I do well this sprint?
 <br> I did not really timebox to work through the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" as
 I enjoyed learning. However, I am now behind my schedule and I needed to rush 
 studying the debugging concept which I am not too sure if I understand properly. 

 <br> What can I improve on next sprint?
 <br> As it is very close to starting the bootcamp, I should timebox properly 
 and work on each assignment. I also need to go over the freecodecamp challenges to make
 sure I am confortable with JavaScript before the course starts.
