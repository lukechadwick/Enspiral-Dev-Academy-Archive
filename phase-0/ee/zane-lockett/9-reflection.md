** What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I believe that I have come a long way since I started on this coding journey around three months ago. I have learned a lot, but I fear that there is still a lot that I haven't learned properly, heading into bootcamp.

Even getting through phase-0 seems like a good mini-accomplishment in the end though. There was a lot to take in.

The thing that I did best throughout phase-0 was just digging for answers online, and trying to understand and implement code corectly. I'm a while off becoming efficient at coding without external assistance, but I have the bare bone tools at my disposal.


** What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I possibly got a little bit distracted by other life events during phase-0. Focus is going to be crucial during bootcamp. I have it in me, I just hope that I am not starting from a place that is too far behind the other students.


 ** What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

 I have learned a lot during bootcamp, technically. I hope at least half of it has stuck in my brain.

 The meditation and soft skill learnings have been beneficial and I'm sure will come in handy during bootcamp.
