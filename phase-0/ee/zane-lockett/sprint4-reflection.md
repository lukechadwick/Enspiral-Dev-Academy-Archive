 What did I do well this sprint?
 I really spent a good chunk of time on the freecodecamp javascript lessons. While quite a lot of it went over my head a this stage, I'm glad I stuck at it and got through all of the questions.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 The javascript lessons were a real challenge. I'm hoping it clicks a bit more in the coming weeks.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 My javascript knowledge and understanding!
