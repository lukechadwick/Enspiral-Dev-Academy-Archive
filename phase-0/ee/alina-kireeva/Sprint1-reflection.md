What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't focus enough on my study in general, didn't read some information very attentive, didn't manage my time properly and didn't ask questions when I needed them.
What can I improve on next sprint?
I'll definetely improve my approach: I'll start doing my assignments straight away, without losing a minute. I'll be brave enough to ask for help
