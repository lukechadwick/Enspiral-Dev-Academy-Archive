<h3>What did I do well this sprint?</h3>

<p>
   I am quite proud of the UI that I made
</p>
<p>
   Once I am on a roll writing the Javascripts for the calculator, it is all good from there.

<h3>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h3>

<p>
   At first, I was intimidated by the sprint e.g. can I do that? I was so intimidated by it there was a couple week of no work between the UI and the start of the Javascript.

<h3>What can I improve on next sprint?</h3>

<p>As Nike said: Just do it!</p>
