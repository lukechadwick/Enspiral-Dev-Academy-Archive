<h3>What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?</h3>

<p>It's been almost a decade since I was last in a "learning/school" environment and knew that it could be a challenge managing time between work, study and family commitment</p>

<p>However as I delved deeper into the sprints, I find it easier to manage the time, I would even say almost like a rythm to split time among those three.</p>
   

<h3>What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?</h3>

<p>I am still not used to meditate. Also with the work commitment on weekdays and family on weekends, it si very difficult for me to do team work. I wish I have experienced "pair programming" before bootcamp starts.</p>


<h3>What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?</h3>

<p>Time management, take regular breaks to avoid burn-out and blocks</p>
<p>Researching code in the interweb, apply it to my coding problem</p>
<p>I definitely learned that there is no shame in asking for help</p>
