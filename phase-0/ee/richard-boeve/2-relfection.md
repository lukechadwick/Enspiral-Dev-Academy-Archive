What did I do well in this sprint?

- Got through it, this was a bit of a beast of a sprint!
- Website is looking ok.
- Learned a lot and just as importent, I enjoyed it.
- Have gotten into a rhythm where I am gradually spending more time on study.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

- I think I went beyond the sprint goals without realising, which cost a lot of extra time
- Didn't pay enough attention to the resources provided in the sprint reminder ticket, that wasn't smart... Just noticing that now, while going through this ticket again at the end of the sprint

What can I improve on next sprint?

- Pay more attention to the provided resources
- Move on quicker when I can't get something 100% to work
