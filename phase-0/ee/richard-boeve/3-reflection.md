What did I do well in this sprint?

- Picked up the pace a bit. I got through sprint 3 a lot quicker than sprint 2. The work load was less, but I was more focused and better with time management.

- Site seems to be fully responsive.

- Still missing some command of CSS tags, but overall I feel that when something doesn't look the way I want it, I at least have a clue as to where to go to fix it.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

- Struggled with the hierarchy of CSS. I had this persistent problem and found that I had placed a CSS class in the wrong spot so it actually didn't apply itself.

What can I improve on next sprint?

- I need to find a way to spend more time on study in the weekend. During the week I seem to be fine, but in the weekend there are more distractions.
