What did I do well in this sprint?

- Increased javascript knowledge
- Asked for help when I got stuck and was helped out

What didn't I do well this sprint?

- Lost a bit of confidence with the minesweeper assignement

What can I improve on next sprint?

- Stay confident in my own abilities
- Same as last week: My javascript knowledge, but otherwise I try to be kind to myself and think I am actually doing well! I am dividing time between work, EDA and a Blockchain Strategy course and try to fit in training and I am managing so far.
