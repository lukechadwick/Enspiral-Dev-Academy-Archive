What did I do well in this sprint?

- Worked hard last week to stay on track and finish before Bootcamp

What didn't I do well this sprint?

- Struggled with some of the Javascript exercises and had to look at the forum to get some pointers to advance.

What can I improve on next sprint?

- Hopefully my Javascript, I don't think that has really stuck yet.
