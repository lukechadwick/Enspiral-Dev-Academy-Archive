What did I do well in this sprint?

- Used peer programming for the first time
- I enjoyed working together on an assignment
- Learned that there needs to be a balance between peer programming and having time by yourself to 'investigate and ponder over'


What didn't I do well this sprint?

- During peer programming, we didn't keep track well enough of time meaning we didn't switch the 'driver' often enough

What can I improve on next sprint?

- Knowledge wise a lot, process wise I think I did ok.
