What did I do well in this sprint?

- Increased javascript knowledge
- Understood what was being taught

What didn't I do well this sprint?

- Couldn't work out some of the exercises
- Spent less time on EDA, mostly because work was busier than normal

What can I improve on next sprint?

- Obviously my javascript knowledge, but otherwise I try to be kind to myself and think I am actually doing well! I am dividing time between work, EDA and a Blockchain Strategy course and try to fit in training and I am managing so far.
