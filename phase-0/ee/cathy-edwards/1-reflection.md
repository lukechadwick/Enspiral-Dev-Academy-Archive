# What did I do well this sprint?
* I spent a while getting my coding tools set up for study during Sprint 1. This is because I own a Microsoft Surface more than anything else. I did already have Windows Subsystem for Linux and Ubuntu installed on my Surface, so that saved a lot of time.
* I had some Git and GitHub experience prior to starting my EDA journey. However, this was the first time I had managed to build sites from scratch and commit them to GitHub entirely from the command line. This is a really, really, really big deal for me!
* I picked up bash and git commands a lot more quickly than I thought I would.

# What didn't I do well this sprint?
* I didn't manage my time well after work to put in more effort into the first sprint. Some days I would be drained of motivation to do anything for my study. At the end of the day, I'm just letting myself down and those around me when I rock up to the cohort to find I'm not prepared enough for the bootcamp.
* That said, I didn't timebox myself well at work or at home for study.
* I also tried to power through and get all of Sprint 1 done in a few sittings. This means I don't go as deeply as I would like with learning all I can from this material and reflecting on it.

# What can I improve on next sprint?
* Practice timeboxing techniques at work.
* Building good habits: short, concise yet more quality bursts of work and study.
