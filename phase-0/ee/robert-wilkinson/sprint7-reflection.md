What did I do well this sprint?


I persisted in getting through quite a lot of the free code camp exercises. I also gritted it out with getting a general understanding on how to use dev tools. 



What didn't I do well this sprint?


I stuffed up a bit a first when going through dev tools debugging video, when my debugger was not paused on same line as his code and this was due to it nor being deactivated. After much persistance I managed to get the same as the video. I am still not quite there with debugging completely, but I think over time and with practice, I will learn the best way to handle debugging and variable watching.  



What can I improve on next sprint?


Next sprint, I feel that I will need to improve on debugging, as I will have quite a lot of code to write with the calculator. I will also need to take care of myself in terms of well being.
