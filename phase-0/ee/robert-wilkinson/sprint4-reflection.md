What did I do well this sprint?


I felt that I went through the basic javascript challenges reasonably quickly and this was due to a planned approach. I asked for a bit of help on slack when I needed it towards the end on these challenges and this meant I wasn't stuck for too long before moving on. With the javascript basics I felt that I didn't make the answers to hard too understand and kept it fairly simple, so that a non-technical person would understand. Lastly I didn't spend too long on the cultural blog.




What didn't I do well this sprint?

The only thing I can think of is, maybe I focused a bit too much towards the end on changing the functionality of the links to a drop down menu.  
However when I had a look at Sprint 5, I actually discovered that concepts for classes related to links is covered in more detail. 
Again from my previous reflection in Sprint 3, it's just knowing what the most important tasks are to get done before moving on.





What can I improve on next sprint?

I can't think of too much, but just managing time well for each of the tasks, as it looks to be quite a big sprint. Just getting the drop down links to hamburger menu functioning to an acceptable level, as quickly as I can would be good.
