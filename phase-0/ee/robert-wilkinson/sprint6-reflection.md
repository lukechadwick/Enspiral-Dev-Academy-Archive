What did I do well this sprint?

i did the technical blog really well, as I feel that I kept the answers fairly easy to understand.





What didn't I do well this sprint?

i got blocked on the first part of minesweeper due to the instructions. Due to lack of time I haven't got it up on GitHub Pages.  




What can I improve on next sprint?

Hopefully I don't get stuck on any thing.
