 What did I do well this sprint?
 I finally get to spend more time to study and tried to give myself some breaks while studying. I think it was good for myself to build my website from the scratch.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?
 I wasted too much time on focusing on small things as I wanted my website to look perfect as I imagined.
 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Still need to do more meditation often as i could have it as an everyday routine.
