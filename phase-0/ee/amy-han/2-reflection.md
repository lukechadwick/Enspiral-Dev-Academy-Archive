 What did I do well this sprint?<br>
 Finish Sprint 2 within one week as planned.
 What didn't I do well this sprint?<br>
 Always forgot to start toggl and still struggle to manage my time.<br>
 I am not sure if I have understood "branch" properly but I am sure I will get it soon as I continuously work on it.
 What can I improve on next sprint?<br>
 Keep pushing myself and try meditation more.
