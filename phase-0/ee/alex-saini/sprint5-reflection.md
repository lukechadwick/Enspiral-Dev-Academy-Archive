What did I do well?

I timeboxed really efficiently this week. Time management skills coming along well.

What didn't I do well?

I don't think I did anything toooo shabby this week (there would've been something I just can't think of it) -
heaps of things I want to improve on though!

What can I improve on?

I know that I can improve on solving and debugging problems that I have with some peices of JS that I'm writing.
I also want to focus more, I feel like I am getting blocked quite often and when that happens I am wanting to go and look
at similar code to find out my problem. I feel as if I want to learn JS I need to be doing more problem solving than I am
when I get blocked BEFORE looking at resources online.
