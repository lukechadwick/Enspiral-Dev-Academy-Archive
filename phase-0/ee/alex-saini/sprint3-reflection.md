What did I do well this sprint?

I timeboxed my website well and stuck to the schedule!

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I didn't manage my time well for the blogs. I need to work faster but keep the same quality of content.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Again, time management. If I am to make my bootcamp I need to manage my time really well!
