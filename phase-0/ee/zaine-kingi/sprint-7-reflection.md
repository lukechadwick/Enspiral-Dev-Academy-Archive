## What did I do well this sprint?
This sprint I done really well revising JavaScript concepts and features I am familiar with. I feel I applied myself and am becoming confident using the built-in array methods.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I have developed a bit of a habit of putting off the reading materials of Search Inside Yourself. This sprint I put off reading chapter six for far too long, and lacked the motivation to finish the readings.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
Motivation to power through the last few chapters of SIY.
