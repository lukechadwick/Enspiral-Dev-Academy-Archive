## What did I do well this sprint?
In this sprint, when I worked on the sprint tasked I would finish them fairly quickly and absorbing at a fairly fast rate.
I also found being able to affiliate personal experiences with reading materials really help absorb and understand the teachings and concepts.

## What didn't I do well this sprint?
I feel I never applied enough of my time, which has been a problem in the past 2 sprints due to other commitments.

## What can I improve on next sprint?
I feel allocating more time for my sprints would be a great start.
