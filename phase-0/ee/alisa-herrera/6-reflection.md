 What did I do well this sprint?
    
    This sprint I did well at making the check-ins despite the other commitments I am juggling at the moment. I also did well at troubleshooting. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

    Over the course of phase 0 I have been pretty good at working on the assignments every 1-3 days. This sprint I didn't work on the assignments as often, but I had some pretty big life events happening that I prioritised above the speed of my phase 0 work. I am aware and okay with my decision.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

    Next sprint I want to do a little bit everyday.
