What did I do well this sprint?

I'm trying to improve my timekeeping and this was a good experiment to tackle. I spent more time focusing on what were the important aspects of the sprint.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I've spread most of each sprint in parts so I can complete each part seperately. I end up having gaps doing non-web based stuff. I hope to improve on my process as I move on. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

I'd like to complete a sprint in one session, since I've spread most of the work sporadically.

Edit: I initially thought this was a good thing, but decided its best if I focus on the process per study session instead of doing it all in one go.
