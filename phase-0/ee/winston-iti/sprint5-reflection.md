What did I do well this sprint?

I think I've managed to understand the DOM Model and how to refer to it in javascript a bit better. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I may have taken my time doing sprint 5, mostly due to my own mental health and lack of sleep. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

I think I can speed up my process.
