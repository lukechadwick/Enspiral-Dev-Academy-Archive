What did I do well this sprint?

I really enjoyed working on the minesweeper exercise. While It took me some time to work out, and required me to look at others code, I still enjoyed seeing how the parts went together. I also enjoyed finding examples on how to implement sounds in javascript, and while it was partcularly easy to find online and implement, it did help me understand how javascript uses filetypes just a little but better.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I think I may have skipped some of the resources in the 6.0 module. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

I'd like to improve on checking out the given resources and timeboxing it in toggle. I've been neglecting the given resources and hope to check them more often on the last set of sprints.
