What did I do well this sprint?

For the most part, I moved through the Minesweeper exercises quite quickly and efficiently. Again, most of this plays to my strengths and prior knowledge which helps a lot! Also, as I've been doing Dev Academy I've noticed overall that I have improved so much with the amount of work I can get done at once, my focus and dedication. My time management skills are also better than they were before they started. I don't know if it's the mindfulness practice or something else, but I've definitely improved in a lot of soft skills during my time doing this dramatically already.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I got stuck on the "finishing touches" section for Minesweeper. If I had more time (and the beginning of bootcamp wasn't a rapidly approaching date) then I think I could have gotten it all working the way I wanted to, but I decided to move on so I can finish phase 0 in time.

What can I improve on next sprint?

The same things I can always improve on or maintain: reaching daily goals and maintaining meditation practice.
