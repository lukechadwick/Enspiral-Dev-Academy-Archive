What did I do well this sprint?

Again, like last sprint I moved through the material quickly, with a lot of my prior experience with coding being helpful. I timeboxed each section of the sprint (2 hours each for larger sections, 1 hour for blogs) to make sure I finish each sprint in time for the bootcamp, but found I made progress much faster than I'd allowed for which is always good!

What didn't I do well this sprint?

There was one section of the dot game that didn't work exactly as expected, however I wanted to keep moving on and not get caught up in debugging since finishing the sprint and moving forward so I can be finished with Phase 0 by Aug 6 is my priority. I also struggle to stay focused on reading the book chapters, not because I don't find it interesting but because readings have always been something I've struggled with (ADHD), so it takes a lot longer for me than it might otherwise.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I'm going to continue timeboxing each section so I can finish each sprint in the space of 1-2 days as the countdown now to the bootcamp is getting tight. In terms of understanding the content itself, I'm feeling confident in my abilities.
