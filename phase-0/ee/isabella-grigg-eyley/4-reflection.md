What did I do well this sprint?

    I went through the material way faster than I expected which was good! My experience with C# I think will pay off now I'm working with Javascript, as I'm familiar with all the concepts that were discussed in the Basic Javascript part of this sprint- most of them are identical to C# in format, or very similar to it. I'm looking forward to more challenging Javascript work in sprint 5 and onwards!

What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I had some trouble with the website (the tutorial one linked for Javascript) at multiple points which I found frustrating, although I think that's more design flaws on their end. But otherwise I had no major problems with this sprint and I think I got through it pretty effectively. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

    No real changes from usual: time management, which I've become far better with during this course already, and maintaining those daily habits of meditation and asking questions before and after my work day about goals and challenges.
