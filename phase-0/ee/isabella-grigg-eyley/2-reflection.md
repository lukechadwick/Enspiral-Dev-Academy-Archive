NB: I'm doing this a while after finishing the rest of the sprint (as I finished all of sprint 2 except the cultural reflection, then came back to it and finished that later). So my recollections aren't as strong as they would have been immediately after- something that I've realised means I can't do that (leaving material and coming back later) in the future, so this will be a one-off.

Udacity tutorials 1 & 2 on HTML and CSS

What did I do well this sprint?

    I think I picked up on the material fairly quickly. I also spent a lot of time learning how individual HTML and CSS elements and features work through online research, which I think is the real key to learning any kind of code or new software- endlessly Googling until you figure out how to do something! So as much as it padded out my time on this sprint, I think it's for the better in the long term and something I'll keep up.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

    My biggest problem with this sprint has been time management as a result of being sick, away for a week then sick again! That's also in general my biggest weakness, although as mentioned in other blogs I think I'm getting better at it. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

    As mentioned, time management is my biggest issue. I'm working now on getting into a daily routine, which I think will make a big difference. It's also I think about developing the habit of starting EDA work first thing in the morning, which I've started with one of the time management resources in mind (I can't remember the name of the researcher who discussed it, but it's the one about having an easy task immediately after a trigger action you already do). So for me, I turn on my computer and make a cup of coffee, and as I have the coffee I read through my EDA tasks that I want to get through that day. I may add in the questions suggested by one of the reflection resources too: what my goals and challenges for the day are. I think that will help a lot.
