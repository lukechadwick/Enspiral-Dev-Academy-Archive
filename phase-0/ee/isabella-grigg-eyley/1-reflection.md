    What did I do well this sprint?

I think I progressed well with understanding the concepts being taught- I had no problems with the material on an intellectual, learning level and I feel confident in my abilities moving forward to keep up with the material. I think I'm also improving in time management skills, in developing habits and pushing myself to do more each day. It's becoming easier to do more and more each time, which is good particularly for moving forward through the course.

    What didn't I do well this sprint?

While I'm improving in time management as mentioned, I still have a way to go in developing those consistent habits. I also feel I could have done more in the time I had, although I was ill and have been visiting family which made keeping up with my initial plan to get things done harder than I hoped. 

    What can I improve on next sprint?

I'll be returning to Wellington in a couple of days and can get back into my normal routine, so that in itself will help. I think keeping in mind some of the time/habit management techniques mentioned earlier will really help too- not expecting myself to be at my goal time immediately, but slowly working up to it so I can get in the habit without burning out. As much as it's clearly an opportunity for learning skills, I think this course in how self-directed it is is also turning out to be an incredibly valuable exercise in developing self-management and I think I'll only be improving over each sprint.
