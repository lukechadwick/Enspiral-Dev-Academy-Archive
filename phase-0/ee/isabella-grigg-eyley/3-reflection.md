What did I do well this sprint?

    I think I learned a lot more about how CSS works through general Googling and reading tutorials. I also am getting a lot from the book chapters about meditation, and I think particularly the idea of gently redirecting your focus when distracted, viewing it as an opportunity for growth, as opposed to resenting when it happens is something I will carry forward, as well as mindfulness meditation practice. I'm also quite happy with my site redesign.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

    There were a few features that I couldn't implement or still don't work exactly as I planned (listed on my Wishlist blog page), which was frustrating. I also found aspects of CSS frustrating to work with at times, usually things like making elements align correctly or keeping the aspect ratio of images. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

    Again, as usual time management is my biggest area that I'm working on. I'm also still maintaining the habit of asking morning and evening goal/challenge questions, which I've written on my whiteboard next to my desk to remeber until it becomes habitual. That and getting into the habit of mindfulness meditation daily is my next goal.
