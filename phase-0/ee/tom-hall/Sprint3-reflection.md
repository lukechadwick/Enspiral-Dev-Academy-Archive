1) What did I do well this sprint?

Wireframing went well in this sprint as I have had some past experience in this before. The Youtube video on 'Designing Responsive Websites with Clarissa Peterson' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMWfttbUvGE) was interesting & helpful. Also I enjoyed reading Chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself.


2) What didn't I do well this sprint?

Struggled a little bit on Assignment 'Build Your Redesigned Site', especially with incorporating the classes for rows and columns. Also with making the website responsive to all screen sizes.

Example Below

<div class="row">
<div class="six columns">

.blog-image {
width: 100%;
height: auto;
}


3) What can I improve on next sprint?

Reading through the sprint concept resources in more depth & making notes on them.
