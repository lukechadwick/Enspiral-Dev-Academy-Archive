1) What did I do well this sprint?

I enjoyed reading the free book 'Eloquent JavaScript' & this went reasonably well.

Chapter 2 "Program Structure" of Eloquent Javascript:
I enjoyed http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html


2) What didn't I do well this sprint?

I struggled a little on the JavaScript games when involving:

JavaScript Selectors
JavaScript Events
Altering the DOM
Event-driven DOM modification


3) What can I improve on next sprint?

Doing more examples & writing out my code more.
