OMG Sprint 4 has been tough. BUT, I got through it. Although the JS stuff from free code camp was really long and sometimes pretty hard and frustrating, I got through it and managed pretty well to troubleshoot problems.

I've let my frustrations get to me somewhat and have struggled a bit with staying focused so I'm going to work on that (maybe I should actually just try the meditation stuff instead of being a cynic about it all).

I think that's pretty much all I can thing of right now so will give myself a rest and dive into sprint 5 after the weekend :).
