Ahhhhhh, reflection on the whole of phase 0 eh? So I have trouble remembering what I did two days ago so may not be the best at remembering how I felt 8 weeks ago but I'll try. 

I do remember getting actual study headaches in the first few days, it honestly felt like I was working my brain in a way that it hadn't been exercised in a very long time, if ever. Thankfully these passed after a few days.

I really do feel like I've learnt alot so far and am excited about learning much more. I had alot of blocks along the way but managed my way out of them mostly.
I'm pretty confident with CSS HTML and command line but NOT with Javascript so I am very nervous about this.

I'm pretty happy with my progress so far and how my habits have changed a little with not throwing my toys so much when I get stuck. I probably would've liked to keep up my pace and have finished sprint 9 before this week but that hasn't happened.

As mentioned above, my emotional habits have developed to a better place which will strongly help during bootcamp, I also am happy with how I've developed my troubleshooting skills with knowing what to look for and where.
