Sprint 3 has definitely been a challenging one for me. I definitely struggled with grasping the CSS stuff which was hard BUT I persisted while maintaining low stress levels and actually really enjoyed working my way through troubleshooting to get a desired result, which brought a lot of satisfaction.

I have improved my time keeping but that is still a work in progress. I should probably have limited my time on certain tasks but in the end I did managed to keep to the process over product idea.

I'd really like to push myself in the next sprint in terms of time, not hours so much but the days that I take to get them so that will involve putting more hours in per day. Ideally I'd like to knock a day off my sprint time, at the moment, that being 5 working days, I'd like to get that down to 4 days so I can get ahead of schedule and hopefully keep it that way.
