Sprint 6 was interesting. I kept good time, which I am pleased about. I also did well navigating issues and finding solutions.

I am going to press on into sprint 7 for now, though I haven't completed 6.4, I am going to push forward and come back to that a little later on to make changes to my minesweeper board once I have a better understanding of Javascript.
