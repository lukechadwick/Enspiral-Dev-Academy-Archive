There are a couple of things I think I did well in Sprint 1. Firstly, going in fairly blind I think I did well to grasp some of the technical concepts. I love using command line and am feeling fairly confient working within that environment (I got my Linux nerd Dad to give me a few tips). I finally clicked last night on how the relationship between CSS and HTML works which I'm pretty happy with. My time keeping I think was pretty good considering it's not a strong suit of mine. I'm also happy with how I managed my stress when hitting blocks.

I feel like CSS was something that really blocked me. I'm going to need to find a way to get enthused about the design side of things but I'm sure that'll come with knowledge and experiencing a lot more functionality. I am also TERRIBLE at reading, it's always been hard for me and I find it's not a very good way for me to process information. I really struggled with reading alot of content, I'm definitely going to need to find some tools to work with or around this. Work-arounds I used for this sprint were taking a lot of breaks between reading large blocks of content and  focusing more on taking in information from the audio/visual content. All of these I will work to improve on going into the future sprints.
