Time-wise I've done well this sprint. I'm also pleased with my problem solving and am happy about my comfort levels of working within JavaScript, although I still have a tonne to learn. I'm happy with my blog posts aswell.

I don't think there's too much I didn't do well but could probably improve my self-care and self-kindness.
