<h2>What did I do well this sprint?</h2>

I am pretty happy about having used a lot of debugging and console.logging for this sprint. I think that I really got the meaning and the importance of using them only now. I also got into doing "mini" commits which I think is very much cleaner and helped me quite a lot recover some structure when I was just "coding wild" especially with the Javascript part of the calculator. I realized that trying some things out can be efficient, but if I don't keep track of the code and effect the logic of any tried out code gets lost and becomes side noise for the rest of the file.


<h2>What didn't I do well this sprint?</h2>

I DEFINITIVELY think I should have paired this sprint out. I can find a lots of excuses about why I didn't paired (I tried finding a pair and when meeting was too hard I just let it go) but I know how much the experience of building a calculator app would have been exponentialy better shared with someone.

<h2>What can I improve on next sprint?</h2>

I haven't read at all the extent of the next sprint to come, but if it involve pairing. I will fight to do so. Otherwise, I guess I will keep on this track, probably trying to give meditation a bigger space and some of the Pomodoro method out a little more as chunks of 25 minutes seems actually often efficient enought if the thinking process while being on it is really focussed.
