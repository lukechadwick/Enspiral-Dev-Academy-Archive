 <h2>What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?</h2>

I am so glad that I kept throught exercising and practicing coding during the extended time frame I had to go through the all material of Phase 0. 
I did well on keeping on with the material and bringing reflection to it on side projects. 

 <h2>What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?</h2>

I could have managed to go through Phasae 0 with an enhanced management of my schedule. Working in the restaurant was sometimes a little bit of an excuse to feel lazy about my own objectives. I do wish I went more often on campus or tried harder to pair with people of my future cohort.  

 <h2>What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?</h2>

 I have worked a lot on my reluctance to ask questions. I find that I am now more confortable about not knowing how to do something, I still struggle to find the best time to ask. 
 I have more introduced meditation habit and thinking in my routine which is good.
 I also got into the habit to make small commits.
 I think all of it will reveal beneficial during Bootcamp.
