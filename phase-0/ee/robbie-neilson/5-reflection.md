What did I do well this sprint?
    This sprint I did ok with a lot of the code, I still don't feel I've really got how to string the JS together even when I understand what I want to do. I reached out for help when I was against a wall and had some grea help.
What didn't I do well this sprint?
    When I got stuck with the code I was really stuck. I had not idea what to do with it and that made me feel pretty de-powered, I didn't like it. I had also assumed I would continue working along at a certain speed and got held up on this.
What can I improve on next sprint?
    I thought it would be better to try and time box more work earlier (in the week and the day) so if I get stuck and have to ask around there is more 'wait' time until I receive feedback.
