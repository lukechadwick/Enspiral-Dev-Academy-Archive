Sprint 8 Reflection

 What did I do well this sprint?
    I created a calculator using javascript and didn't rely on any answers or copy paste code. It was very challenging but I never gave up and 
    assigned myself bite sized pieces at a time. My first night was creating barebones HTML and linking it to CSS and Javascript files. 
    The next night, I drew up a rough outline of the calculator and added buttons without any styling. A few nights later I finally had 1+1 working! Fast forward to now, 
    and I think my calculator is really awesome! Well...the refactored version :) 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
    My refactoring could have been way better but I gave up on assigning the value to a variable for each symbol. I feel like the problem was due to my 
    usage of == and === throughout my code. I did re-write a switch statement and it looked awesome but it messed up the rest of my code outside of the statement. 
    I thought it's best to submit the refactor as best as I could and not dwell on it for too long. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
    I'm really proud of myself this sprint, my stress levels were low, my time management was awesome, my study/work/life balance is amazing. I started eating 
    healthy and exercising often. If I could pick something to improve on, it'd be catching up on sleep and stretching more often.
