What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I knew starting out, that the biggest challenge for me was going to be finding that balance between work, life, study and other hobbies. The first few weeks it was evident that I'd not yet found the right balance - I was focusing too much on study or feeling over worked and avoiding study.

As I developed and learned more throughout the sprints, my self management improved and I managed to identify my priorities and bring balance into my life. I'm really proud that I've managed to get to sprint 9 earlier than intended and I think my previous coding experience has helped a lot. I'm overjoyed that I bought kindness, effort and integrity to every sprint and submitted work that was above what was asked of me, on time.

Lastly, somehow...the last nine sprints have really improved my life at work and at home. I'm feeling better now, than I was back at the start of 2018.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I could have timed my work more accurately between devices. I've been completing sprints between two laptops and my desktop, this often lead to manually adding time to Toggl. 

I would have liked to undertake more partner / team work but that was challenging due to my working hours. 

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

Study, work and life balance. This is really essential as I value my time highly. This will carry me through bootcamp valuing every minute and doing my best work possible. 

I have learned to be more understanding and a better person overall. This will help me take feedback and deliver feedback, and become a well rounded team member. 

Researching code and asking for help, this will be a daily task during bootcamp. 

Meditating and taking regular breaks to avoid blocks.
