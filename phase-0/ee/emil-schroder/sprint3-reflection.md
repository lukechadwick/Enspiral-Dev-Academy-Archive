What did I do well?

The way I timed things out and did the work regularily without making excuses I thought was a vast improvement on the previous sprint.

What didn't I do well?

I did a bit to much trial and error when making changes within the skeleton framework. I ended up slowing down and making thoughtful changes but at the start frustration got the better of me.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Making time for the meditation side of things. This is the thing that gets missed if I am pushed for time, so I need to make it more of a focus next sprint.
