What did I do well this sprint?

I trusted myself. My final week at work was last week and so I decided that I needed to spend my time making sure that everything was prepped for my leaving which meant some late stays and almost a whole week of forfieting my usual Dev Academy time to donate towards this. 

I was confident that given I had entire free days throughout July to work on this stuff I would have the capacity not to regret that decision. So far I have managed to complete sprint 5 in a bit over a day and a half so I feel justified.

What didn't I do well on?

I need to get my home setup sorted as it is currently unideal and I haven't thought too much about it.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Maintain focus and pace.
