What did I do well?

The speed at which I got through things was great. I have much more time during the day to do things now so I am feeling good about dedicating larger chunks of time to a task.

What didn't I do well?

I backslid a wee bit into the trial-and-error programming that I've been trying to steer away from. I found myself changing something then immediately testing it without really thinking through whether the change made sense or not.

What can I improve on?

Besides the trial-and-error habit I want to get better control over my anger. The mindfullness techniques have definately helped with that so far so I have to just apply them more often.
