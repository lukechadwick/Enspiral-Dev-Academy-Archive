What did I do well?

I got stuck into the JS component and really powered through it, even when I got incredibly blocked on one particular exercise. That felt like the first time I was tested in a non-semantic way and it was good to ultimately overcome.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I need to work on prioritising the meditation aspect of our learning. It is not always the top of my mind and it gets missed easily.

Improve?

Time allocations. They were good this sprint, but lacked a structure that probably could have helped.
