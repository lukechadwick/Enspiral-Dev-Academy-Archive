What did I do well?

Problem solving relating to getting the calculator up and running. Also knowing when I should keep pushing with the work and when I should stop and have a break.

What did I not do well?

Nothing to bad this week, could have organised my sleep schedule better.

What can I improve on? 

Cleaning up my website and making everything flow better. Also researching more into design practices.
