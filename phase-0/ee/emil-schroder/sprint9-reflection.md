What did I do well throughout my nine sprints?

I alotted time well. This allowed me to take time to go off on tangents (like some failed projects or reading a book on graphic design) 
without having to worry that I wasn't going to hit my goal of finishing phase 0 in time.

What could have I done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

I felt I was weak in the design aspect of making a website look good so I have started to patch that hole with some readings.
I had a hard time coming back to the meditation practices, I want to improve on that.

What learnings and habits will help me at bootcamp?

Debugging was a big one, as well as the initial boxifying design of a website. Additionally, to come to bootcamp with a sense of exploration rather than focussing on pass/fail has put me in the right place.
