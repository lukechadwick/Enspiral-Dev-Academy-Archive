What did I do well?

I felt like I changed my thinking well to adopt a calmer mindset when
approaching the issues I had with my code. Often when there are problems
I will tailspin somewhat and just start trying trial-and-error approaches
rather than thinking through the problem in a constructive, logical way.
Reigning in my panic allowed me to think through the structure of my html
and accurately predict what the changes I made to it would actually do.

What didn't I do well?

Time management is still something I am working out. I feel like I am
spending enough time on work, but other things I want to do, like play 
games, gets pushed off to the side because I feel as if they are eating into
work time. In reality there is time for both and I just need to plan better.
I am also awful at remembering to starting the Toggl timer.

What can I improve on?

Timeboxing and playing around a bit more with my stuff. I have fun doing 
that but I don't do it enough.
