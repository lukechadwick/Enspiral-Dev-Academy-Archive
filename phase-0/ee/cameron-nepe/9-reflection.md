What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Didn't give up. Came up with the fees. Still a bit to go in paying but nearly there. Moved on, didn't stay blocked.   

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Spend more time on tutorials. I think paying for the course first wouldv'e helped then I could have dedicated full-time to phase-0.

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
Learn together as a group. Don't be afraid to ask for help and do the work.
