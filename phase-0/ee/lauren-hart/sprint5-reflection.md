What did I do well in this sprint?

I managed to work through quite a few of the activities at a
reasonable pace. Whenever I got stuck on something I wouldn't dwell on it,
I would try and find the answer and work through the solution with google etc. 

What didn't do I do well in this sprint?

Perhaps not understanding the concepts as well as I like. 
By working at a good pace I may not be picking up on things very well. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

To continue working at a good pace but try and understand things before moving on.
