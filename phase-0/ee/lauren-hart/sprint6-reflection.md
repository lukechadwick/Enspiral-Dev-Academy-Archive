What did I do well this sprint?

I did well in problem solving in this sprint and 
reached out to the code help desk for the first time. 
I also have become quite used to using the console.log
function to help me work through problems.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I got quite blocked on minesweeper and kept putting off
the challenge. When I finally sat down and really 
concentrate on finishing it it wasn't so bad. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

I need to work on my perserverance. When things are 
getting tricky my mind starts wandering and it takes 
me a lot longer. When that happens I need to really 
work on keeping my concentration levels and work through the 
problem.
