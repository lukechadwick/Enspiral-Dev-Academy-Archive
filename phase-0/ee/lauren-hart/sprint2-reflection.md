What did I do well this sprint?

I managed my time quite well and even though I am very busy at work I still managed to put in at least 2 hours every night and a good 5 hours each day on the weekend. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I still get stuck on little things and don't move on until I get them. It can be good as I eventually am able to figure out the problem but can end up wasting too much time on it.

What can I improve on next sprint?

When I get stuck on something I think it is best to just walk away or start another task and come back to it with a fresh set of eyes.
