What did I do well this sprint?

I thought I did well perservering this week. Running through all the javascript activities was challenging but I kept going with it all and if I needed to I would walk away for a few minutes and come back to it. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
 
I would get quite stuck on some of the answers to the problem so I found myself looking up the solutions quite often. Most of the time it was just minor things that I was missing and probably could have figured them out if I just spent a bit more time on them. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

Understanding the concepts a bit better whilst I'm doing them rather than just ticking off the task.
