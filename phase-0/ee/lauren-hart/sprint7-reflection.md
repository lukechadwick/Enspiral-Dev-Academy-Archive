 What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint was a lot of new concepts and I thought I did well trying to apply them at each problem solving question. I found when working through the problems it helped me to write it down and break the question out to try and understand what was required. 

I still needed to use google quite a bit for some of the questions so I utilised other resources to help me. 

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I spent a bit longer trying to work through the solutions then I would have liked (and was recommended).

I struggled to figure out how to use the debugger and have continued using console.log.

 What can I improve on next sprint?

 Moving a little bit quicker. Keep trying to use the debugger.
