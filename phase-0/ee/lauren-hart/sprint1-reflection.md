What did I do well this sprint?

I thought I did well in keeping up with my study each day, I managed to stick to my planned timetable which I though I would have trouble with. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

There were times when I got quite stuck and spent too much time trying to find out how to fix it. I ended up asking Aimee how to move the fruit file (as she she had already moved fruit into mine). It was just one simple little thing I was missing in my code. If I had asked someone sooner I wouldn't have wasted so much time. 


What can I improve on next sprint?

Next sprint I will work through the tasks on waffle and read through the material as I go and when it relates to the task at hand. I kept jumping through different reading materials and didn't do it in the most fluid and productive way.
