What did I do well this sprint?

I did well at looking up things I wasn't sure of. It took me a while to understand the skeleton framework but I found a couple of youtube videos to watch which helped. There were other things that I implemented in my website which I did through researching (my dropdown menu for example).

I really enjoyed learning about the design aspects of a site this week. 


What didn't I do well this sprint?

I did my site without testing on mobile first and had to go back and try and do it from scratch to get the mobile portion working. I got it working and then made some adjustments and have gone back to test the mobile site but it isn't working again. I have spent way too long playing around with it and I need to move on to the next sprint. I think I am really struggling with process over product. I am a bit of a perfectionist and can't move on to something else until I have perfected what I am working on. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

I need to move a bit quicker and focus more on learning rather than getting my website right.
