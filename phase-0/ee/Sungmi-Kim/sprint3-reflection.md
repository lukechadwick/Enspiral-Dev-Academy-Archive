# Here we go my favorite reflection time!

### What did I do well this sprint?
I was doing well to create file and change the name of img folder to images,
I created img folder in the begining but it needed to be 'images'so I changed :smile:

### What didn't I do well this sprint?

I did in my css 
```
@media only screen and (max-width:400px) {
    .navcontainer {
        background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #a1d3b0, #f6f1d3);
        height: auto;
        width: 100%;
    }
    .navigation {
        margin: 10px 30px 0 50px;   
    }
    .navigation a, .dropdown-btn {
        color: black;
    }
    button:focus {
        color: black;
    }
    .logo {
        margin: 10px 0 10px 220px;
        position: fixed;
    }
    #mylogo {
        width: 75px;
    }
    .maincontatiner {
        margin: 250px 10px 10px 10px;
        position: relative;
    }
    .fa-caret-down {
        float: right;
        padding-top: 8px;
        padding-right: 200px;
    }
    #mydog {
        width: 100%;
    }

    .button {
        text-transform: inherit;
        margin: 5px 50px;
        width: 250px;
        height: auto;
        font-size: 15px;
    }

    footer {
        clear: both;
        margin-left: 10px;
        width: 100%;
        height: 150px;
    }
}
```
it's working well on my laptop screen when I reduces the screen size. However 
when I checked with my iphone6 and my partners sony phone, it's working for the main page and cultural blog pages as a responsive site... :cry:
I am really not sure why it's not working, it's linked with a same CSS ........

### What can I improve on next sprint?

I need to figure it out above's problem before starting Sprint 4, I am going to study more about the responisve via [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893).
