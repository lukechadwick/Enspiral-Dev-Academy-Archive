##Q:What didn't I do well this sprint?
###A:Spent a bit too much time trying to get it perfect...I can appreciate people who can do this as a job and get the code to do as they wish.. Also spent a bit too much time in bootstrap..

##Q:What can I improve on next sprint?
###A)Time keeping and management. And remembering that this is a learning experience and that it doesn't have to be perfect. I do keep trying to learn everything and falling down the rabbit hole. I do like learning but I need to keep moving foward.
