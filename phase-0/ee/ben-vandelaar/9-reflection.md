What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I finished it :P .... But that's the only thing I can think of is that I made it through. I think I'm getting a good grasp on programming though..

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I think I was a bit eager to get through the sprints at the start and rushed them a bit. I also think I.. It's not that I flaffed about 
but more I should have taken my time and worked through the tutorials then once done go over the materials and work on some other tutorials.. I also could've resisted the rabbit hole more, by that I mean to trying to master bootstrap not trying to master css not trying to master javascript and everything it can do. But understand that I'm just starting out in this and that it will take time to properly get a grasp on some of this stuff and not to worry too much about it. I definitely stressed myself out a bit too much I think at some points. 

  What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?

I've figured out that I need to watch/read through make notes and then follow through with my notes to regurgitate it back onto the screen. Knowing this will help that and lots of repetition.
