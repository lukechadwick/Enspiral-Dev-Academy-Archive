# Sprint 3 reflection
## What did I do well this sprint? 
I got through it! I became frustrated with my rebuild and carried on with the next sprint once I recognised I had used up too much time i.e. 'rabbit holing'.
## What didn't I do well this sprint? 
I became frustrated while building my website (3.1) and deleted large chunks from main.css and index instead of re-working it. I only just returned to complete some of the rebuild and have moved on as per process over product approach. 
## What can I improve on next sprint? 
Keep calm and carry on. I have to make my timeboxing way more specific and controlled by breaking down the acitivity into sub-activities.
