 What did I do well this sprint?

 I was able to progress through challenges quite well, if I was stuck I would look through forums.

 What didn't I do well this sprint? What can I improve on next sprint?

 I didn't timebox very well this sprint. I also had a lot going on outside of phase-0 so did not dedicate much time which meant a lot of the js concepts were forgotten when I went back to complete more challenges. Therefore I found myself often looking at help forums and going back through already done challenges to help with any mind blanks. I find it quite difficult to come up with many of the code from the top of my head and find I need a little push to think what I need at first. I am hoping with time this will get better as I would much rather understand the code fully, and be able to work it up from the top of my head as opposed to reading through other peoples work.
