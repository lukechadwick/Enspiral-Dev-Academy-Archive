 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

 I think I managed my time quite well. I was aware of possible busy days/weeks and managed to complete sprint ahead of time in order to be ready for bootcamp. I also feel I was able to work through tasks quite well, with minimal external help.
 
 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 
 Even though I felt like I did not need the external help, I feel like collaborating or meeting with others within my cohort or at the office would have helped me learn differently and possibly more thoroughly, and would have prepared me for the bootcamp experience to come. I also wish I had done less googling of answers, solutions, help etc and have sought help elsewhere as I feel like at times I struggle with knowing when to use specific conceptr or functions for example, and it takes me some time to 'start' the code from scratch, without some sort of template.

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
 I am happy with the basic learning I have developed as I begun with absolutely zero knowlege in tech. I am nervous for what is to come, especially because when I get stuck I tend to doubt myself, howver the mindfulness and perseverence practice has definitely helped me to realise I am not the only one, and in fact, I have learnt a lot from where I had begun.
 I enjoy playing around especially with the CSS and, try to play more with JS as this is my weakness and an area I need to spend more time on to develop.
 I am very excited for bootcamp as I will be able to share, and collaborate with others, as I wasn't as active within the slack groups as I would have hoped due to being busy.
