What did I do well this sprint?

I done well at sticking to the timebox for redesigning my site. I managed to get the structure and main feature I wanted incorporated within a manageable amount of time. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?

In regards to the above, I could have spent more time giving my blogs a bit more caracter, though had put it off, so this will be something I will do during the next sprint as I would like to add some colour and visual elements. I also need to spend more time on the responsiveness of my site as this was slightly neglected. There is responsiveness but I believe I could make it more accessible and efficient for the user on a mobile phone.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I set the functions and elements I wanted to incorporate in my site quite low, going through other sites, I am interested to incorporate a bit more such as an image gallery, that when you hover over the image it magnifys the image. Improving the responsiveness for mobile as it is not quite where I would like it to be, especially when some content is lost at its smalles size.
