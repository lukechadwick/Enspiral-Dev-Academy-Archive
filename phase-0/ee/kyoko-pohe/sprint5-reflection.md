 What did I do well this sprint?

I think I made my way through the sprint quite efficiently. The amount of time I spend on each sprint has been on my mind lately as we are approaching August quite quick, and I am going to be having one week off in Sydney next week. This means I am trying to complete as much as I can, but I alo don't want to rush it as I am trying to really take in the work and concepts. I believe I have been able to do this, even though there are small things I still don't quite understand when it comes to javascript, though I am hoping these will be cleared up shortly or once I am in bootcamp. I managed to follow the tasks quite easily and really enjoyed having the power to change colours of each element.

 What didn't I do well this sprint? What can I improve on next sprint?

 One thing that I noticed is I did not check-in this sprint :| So will have to remember to do so next time. I think all in all I done quite well this sprint, so heres hoping my minesweeper game goes just as smooth.
