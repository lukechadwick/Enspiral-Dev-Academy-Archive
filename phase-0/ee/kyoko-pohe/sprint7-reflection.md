What did I do well this sprint?

I managed to work through the tasks efficiently again, ad dedicated more focus into this sprint. As we continue to dig deeper into JS it is both excting to learn more and have those "aha" moments, though daunting as it is a lot of information, and at times complex. I really enjoeyd learning briefly about debugging and do agree it will be a helpful tool in the future.

 What didn't I do well this sprint? What can I improve on next sprint?

 The free code camp tasks proved to be a bit trickier this time around, and I think I was reverting to more forum help than normal. This meant I wasn't using the time to think up the code, but instead getting hints to rejuggle memory and figure out the code. I would have to say my weakness thus far has always been having a mind blank before I tackle codes. Thinking of what function etc should I use and is it relevant here, and the extra help from the forums in this sprint has proved me to be slightly lazy I would say, and this is something I must work on.
