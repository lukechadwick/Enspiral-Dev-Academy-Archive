 What did I do well this sprint?
    
I really enjoeyd this sprint and feel as though I learnt a lot in one sprint. the Udacity tutorials were my absolute favourite as I think I learnt a lot, which helped me in going forward to structure and beautify my web page and blogs. I did well to dedicate time towards the sprint, and learn as much information as I could.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?  What can I improve on next sprint?

Next sprint will see me trying to better with my time management as I had wanted to have this sprint completed 2-3 days ago. However, not too much of a biggie, just wanting to stick to timelines. There were a few hiccups, and that of creating a pull request really got me in the time department. Ive manage to figure out all blocks I have had so far, which I guess is also a plus as I haven't required outside help as of yet (Though welcome it whenever). I am excited to get into sprint 3, as I see a lot of it is to do with our own web pages and this is something that has been playing on my mind, in terms of me cleaning it up, and getting it to do things I want it to do, such as perfecting the nav bar, and colours etc.
