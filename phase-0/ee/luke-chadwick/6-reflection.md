Understood the concepts required to build minesweeper
What didn't I do well this sprint?
I should probably get more rest and sleep, been pushing myself quite hard with this/work/gym lately, but I have this weekend off so I will relax
What can I improve on next sprint?
Tidy up some code and learn more JS
