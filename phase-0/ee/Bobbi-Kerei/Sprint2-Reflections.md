What did I do well this sprint?

Focus on getting things done in ordered and careful way. I'm really proud of what I've done this sprint.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I broke GitHub. Have hit a point were I can't push anything to Git Hub at all. Working on getting a friend to 
help me figure out what I did here. Just frustarted that I don't ahve more knowledge too understand what I did.
 
 What can I improve on next sprint?

Use this as a lesson for my next sprints on how to not break gitHub again and if I do then how to fix it.
