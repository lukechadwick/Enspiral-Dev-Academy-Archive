What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint I did a good job of learning new techniques that will help me save time and improve accuracy. I invested time into learning keyboard shortcuts and made some improvements to my terminal interface.
I also did a good job of approaching the sprint content with more flexibility than I did in the past. Also I think I have been good at honestly reflecting on how I have done and seeing where I can improve.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I was quite disappointed with my time management of this sprint. There are many more extension exercises I wanted to get on to doing but I feel my progress in this sprint was not good enough to allow me to dedicate the time to these. I allowed some distractions to get in the way of my progress which was unfortunate.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Next sprint I aim to get back on track with my timeboxing and monitoring of my progression. I really want to become stronger in these skills as they're going to be very important in the near future.
