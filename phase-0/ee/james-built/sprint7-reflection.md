What did I do well this sprint?

I did a good job of timeboxing my work. I also did well when it came to questioning the syntax of the code I was seeing in the Eloquent JS
chapter assigned. I was able to recognise something I hadn't come across before (text interpolation) and get an understanding of what was happening
from the context of the code before searching to confirm my understanding.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

This sprint I feel like I became a bit complacent about my progress through phase 0. I think there is more effort I could be putting in
to make sure I finish the material ahead of time and am able to stretch myself a little ahead of the start of bootcamp. I think I could have
completed this sprint faster than I did.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Next spring I will look to move at a quicker pace to cover more material, I think I am building a good understanding but want to cover a broader
range of content so I at least have an exposure to different things I am likely to encounter at bootcamp.
