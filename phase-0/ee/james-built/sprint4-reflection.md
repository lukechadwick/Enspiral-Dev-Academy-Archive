What did I do well this sprint?

I did a good job of steadily working through the JS concepts that were introduced to me and taking notes as I progressed. I found that when I came across the challenge exercises I was well aware of what I needed to do and didn't have to backtrack through the exercises.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I think perhaps I should have scanned through all of the assigned tasks of the sprint before deciding my starting point. The readings from chapter 3 of search inside yourself were very valuable and I think I would probably have chosen to read that first in hindsight.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Reflecting on where I feel I didn't do so well in this sprint I think I will focus on taking some time at the start of the sprint to set out a plan of attack and be flexible in how I approach the content of the next sprint.
