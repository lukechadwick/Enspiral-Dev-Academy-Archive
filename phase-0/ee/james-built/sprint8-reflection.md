What did I do well this sprint?

I did a good job of making sure to reach out to other students. I took the opportunity to pair up with others which helped solidify my own knowledge
and I can see it had a positive impact on the learning of other students. I also think I have done a much better job than I would have in the past
on reflecting on my emotions and understanding what makes me feel happy and how my work and learning fascilitates this.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

During this sprint I finished up at my current job, I took this as an opportunity to decompress ahead of leading into bootcamp which was a good thing
however I think it had a negative effect on my motivation since I feel like letting the intensity drop a little made it harder to pick up the pace again
when I wanted to.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Since I feel the drop in intensity during the last sprint had a negative effect on my intrinsic motivation, the type of "passion" happiness discussed in
search inside yourself, I will make sure to keep the fire going more in this next sprint which will get me back to a state of self sustaining learning
and happiness. Also I will make sure to get back into my routine and have it totally dialled in by the start of bootcamp so I can hit the ground running.
