What did I do well this sprint?

In this sprint I did a good job of working through the material at a good pace and focusing my attention on the skills I was learning rather than the product of the minesweeper game itself. I was happy with the solutions I came up with for some of the stretch goals for this sprint too. Also I am becoming more confident with troubleshooting problems with my code using console logging to find the value of variables and how many times loops have been completed as a couple of examples.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

One thing I noticed was that as I was working on producing my minesweeper board using a function and randomly assigning my mine placement I began to get a bit messy with my coding structure as I was busy trying things out and not focusing on keeping my code clean and properly spaced. I will need to be wary of not building up too much technical debt as the JavaScript I am coding continues to get more complex.

What can I improve on next sprint?

I plan on spending some time doing some extension reading of the elegant JS book with a view to learning best practice for syntax as I am not 100% confident yet on how my code should be typed up for better readability and easier troubleshooting. Also I plan to spend more time practicing pseudo coding as I think this will also help me to keep my code cleaner as I go.
