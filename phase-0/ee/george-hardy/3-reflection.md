What did I do well this sprint?

    Spent more time working on this sprint during the week after work instead of my entire weekend.
What didn't I do well this sprint?

    Still a bit behind. I'm going to dedicate this weekend to finishing sprint-4 to take the pressure off.
What can I improve on next sprint?

    Keep at it and make a habit of getting stuff done after work. Also sleep more :p
