What did I do well this sprint?

    Had a busy weekend but still managed to mostly finish the sprint as planned. Mostly on Saturday with a bit on Sunday and Monday.
What didn't I do well this sprint?

    Other than finishing on Monday instead of Sunday, I think everything went pretty well.
What can I improve on next sprint?

    I'm out of town this weekend so will have to get lots done in the evenings after work to keep the pressure off.
