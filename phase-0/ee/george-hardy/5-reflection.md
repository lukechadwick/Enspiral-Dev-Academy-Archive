What did I do well this sprint?

    Quite happy with my blog nav js solution.
What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I completed most of my the sprint a while ago but didn't put any further work in to finish it off.
What can I improve on next sprint?

    Just keeping to schedule. I'm feeling the time pressure now - this is when I do my best work :) I don't want to be finishing sprint9 right at the last minute though!
