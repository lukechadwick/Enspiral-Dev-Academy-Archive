What did I do well this sprint?

    Really enjoyed working through the algorithm problems. Some parts quite tricky but fun problems to solve.
What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I got a bit frustrated with some of the functional programming concepts. Was feeling very stressed out and not making any progress. I left them and tried them the next day with a clear hear.
What can I improve on next sprint?

    Working faster, but also slowing down to make sure I really understand what I am doing. I will certainly need to put more time in to learning some of the functional programming concepts - I don't have a deep understanding of what is going on.
