What did I do well this sprint?

    Had heaps of fun working on building the calculator assignment. I had initially planned on doing something basic and moving on but actually found it was a really good refresher exercise for html/css layout. I took great satisfaction in meeting all of the use cases.
What didn't I do well this sprint?

    I probably spent more time than I should have on this sprint even though I thought it was time well spent.
What can I improve on next sprint?

    Getting it done before the weekend!
