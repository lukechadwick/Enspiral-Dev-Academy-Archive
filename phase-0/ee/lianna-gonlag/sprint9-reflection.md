 What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I've consistently been conscientious of my time and planned well in terms of 
buffer time and knowing my own tendency to fret/stress over details. I was 
good at knowing when to ask for help and got better at allowing myself to move 
on without completely and totally memorising everything to do with the subject 
studied; it helped a lot when someone suggested I spend *less* time on the 
material, as it wasn't something I'd thought of and it turned out well.

 What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
I could have stressed a lot less, though of course that's easy to say now, 
looking back and knowing that I was in fact able to do it all well enough and 
on time; I forgive my past self for not knowing that. She's a worrier. We're 
rather alike in that sense. 

I would have liked to spend more time working with the other students in my 
cohort, but my work schedule made it next to impossible. A shame, but I think 
I'll still do fine meeting them when bootcamp proper starts. 

 What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
I've become good at timeboxing, reflecting, and playing with my code (i.e. 
"just TRY SOMETHING" rather than analyse in perfect detail to be sure it'll 
work first), become better at problem-solving, and renewed dusty meditation 
and mindfullness habits that always served me well (and why did I fall out of 
those habits? I wish I knew). I've absorbed a lot of theory (if not much 
chance to practice, except at work) on interpersonal relationships and working 
together, and I expect that will help a lot with projects during bootcamp.
