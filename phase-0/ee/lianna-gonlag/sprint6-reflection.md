 What did I do well this sprint?
I managed a lot of problem-solving for the minesweeper game and kept to my timeboxes pretty well.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I didn't get anything close to daily practice and had over a week of no coding thanks to moving house, and I stressed a lot about falling behind.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
Not fall further behind!
