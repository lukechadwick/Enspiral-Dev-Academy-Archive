 What did I do well this sprint?
I've been kind to myself with regards to trying my hardest on a problem 
and knowing when it's time to give up and ask for help. I've been good at 
pacing myself and keeping to timeboxes, and (mostly) keeping my zen even 
when I struggle with technicaly problems.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
For the first time so far I HAD to give up, which bothers me, and on two 
occasions in close succession, which leads me to worry that I'm not 
learning it right. 
Also, maybe not doing this ee reflection thing right? It always seems so 
similar to what I just wrote in my blog post that I feel like I'm repeating 
myself.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
I need to continue to balance my reading time with practical excercises so 
I don't get bogged down in trying to learn everything at once, and I need to 
become more okay with not being able to solve everything myself.
