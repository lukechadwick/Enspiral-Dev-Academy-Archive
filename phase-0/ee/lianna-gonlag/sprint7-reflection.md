 What did I do well this sprint?
I kept to my timeboxes excellently, and in one case completed the exercises in just over half the time allotted.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I've been in a rush trying to catch up after starting the sprint behind schedule, so I didn't take all the time I needed to practice what I've learned. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
Keep on time, try not to stress.
