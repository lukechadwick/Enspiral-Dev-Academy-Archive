 What did I do well this sprint?
I made a calculator! And I refactored it pretty damn well! It could still be
 better, but I evaluated the time left to make the last details work and decided
  to let go of perfection so to keep everything rolling on. 
I also did some sprint 9 work ahead of finishing the tough calculator tasks so 
to keep things varied and avoid getting stuck in a mental rut, which worked nicely.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?
I rushed through the cultural blog task, and I didn't manage to keep working 
regularly on the weeknights I had planned, but that was partially due to illness. 

 What can I improve on next sprint?
Keeping to my study scheudule more closely.
