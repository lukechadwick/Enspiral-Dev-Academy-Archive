What did I do well this sprint?
Udacity HTML & CSS and creating blog posts on my website. 

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I struggled with the paying off technical debt task, I was confused about how I was to do a pull request with the master and tidying branch. Got there in the end, but not 100% sure if I’ve done it correctly…

What can I improve on next sprint?
Definitely need to work on pull requests, branches and working with GitHub in general. Time management is also key because I’m finding it hard working from home and need to create a better routine so I don’t procrastinate.
