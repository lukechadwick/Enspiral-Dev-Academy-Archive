What did I do well this sprint?
I think I did well with the content in this sprint, I found the algorithm scripting challenging but I found ways 
to make it work and learnt alot along the way. I had tonsilitus last week, so I think I did well not falling behind
on my goal to finish sprint 7 by Monday this week.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I'm still struggling with remembering all of the different functions when writing scripts, I have written what we've 
learnt so far down which I can refer back to, this takes a bit of time but hopefully I won't need to continue referring back on every question.

What can I improve on next sprint?
I need to write more comments in my code because I think it's helpful to understand what I did when I look back and for
other people to understand my code too.
