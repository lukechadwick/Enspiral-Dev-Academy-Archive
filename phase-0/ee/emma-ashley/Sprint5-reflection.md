What did I do well this sprint?

I think I did well on the problem solving aspect of this sprint and trying the different techniques to solve them. I've also been meditating every day and when I get stuck on a problem I go for a quick mindfull walk and it really helps to clear my mind.

What didn't I do well this sprint?

I still haven't attended a group discussion, will definitely commit to next week.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Attend a phase-0 group discussion, try the other problem solving techniques. Manage my time more effectively.
