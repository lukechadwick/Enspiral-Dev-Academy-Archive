What did I do well this sprint? 

I’m getting more comfortable using HTML and CSS, and I enjoyed the process of redesigning my website using the boxifying model and creating wireframes.

What didn’t I do well this sprint? 

I didn’t realise that I needed to make my website mobile friendly, even though that’s what I’d read about in the material for this sprint. There were no specific instructions to start with a mobile site first so when I got to my reflection that’s when I realised and tried to fix it. 

What can I improve on next sprint?

I’m not great with media query so definitely a concept I need to make more time for and will update my site when I can.
