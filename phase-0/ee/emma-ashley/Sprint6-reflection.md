* What did I do well this sprint?
This sprint was challenging, I think what I did well was trying different things to solve the different problems. I was finding it really difficult to visualise what I needed to do so I bought a small whiteboard and it helped me a lot to write out what I needed to achieve, to write some pseudo code and then implement it. I am a visual learner and think I have found a way that will really help me learn these concepts and implement them.

*  What didn't I do well this sprint?
I definitely need to meditate more, I meditated only once this sprint when I was reading through the chapter 5. I also didn’t time box myself like I have on other sprints and found I was burning myself out as I wasn’t taking regular breaks.

*  What can I improve on next sprint?
Reflecting, meditating, taking regular breaks.
