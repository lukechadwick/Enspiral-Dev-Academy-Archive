What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?


I think I did well in managing my time, so that I would finish all the sprints before bootcamp started, and have a few weeks to revise the concepts I struggled with. I think I did well problem solving while working on the different exercises, and finding more resources to help me understand the concepts better.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?


I need to improve on my mindfulness and practicing more meditation and journaling. I was too consumed by the content and exercises that I didn’t take the time to take care of myself. 

What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?


I have learnt better time management techniques while working on projects, I’ve also learned that my learning style is very visual and working through examples really helps me to understand the concepts.
