What did I do well this sprint?

I really enjoyed doing the calculator exercise, and think I did well reducing my 
functions from 78 lines to 37. I also commented in my code so it would be easy to
reflect back on, and for other people reading my work to know why I wrote those 
functions.

 What didn't I do well this sprint?

I haven't been taking very good care of myself and need to action what I reflected in
my self care section from the start of this sprint.

What can I improve on next sprint?

Tidying up my code, making my functions shorter, more comments explaining my thought
process. Actioning my self care notes from the start of this sprint.
